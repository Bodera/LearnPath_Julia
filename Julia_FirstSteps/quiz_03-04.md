__Question__: Loop over integers between 1 and 100 and print their squares.  
__Answer__:

```julia
for i ∈ 1:100
  if i == 100
    print("$(i ^ 2)", "\n")
  else
    print("$(i ^ 2), ")
  end
end

__Question__: Add to the code above a bit to create a dictionary, `squares`, that holds integers and their squares as key and value pairs such that: `squares[10] == 100`
__Answer__:

```julia
squares = Dict(i => i ^ 2 for i ∈ 1:100)

for key ∈ sort(collect(keys(squares)))
    println("\t$key <--> $(squares[key])")
end

__Question__: Use an array comprehension to create an an array `squares_arr` that stores the squares for all integers between 1 and 100.

squares_arr = [ i ^ 2 for i ∈ 1:100]
println(squares_arr)
```
