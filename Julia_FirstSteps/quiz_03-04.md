__Question__: Loop over integers between 1 and 100 and print their squares.  
__Answer__:
```julia
for i ∈ 1:100
  if i == 100
    print("$(i ^ 2)", "\n")
  else
    print("$(i ^ 2), ")
  end
end
```

__Question__: Add to the code above a bit to create a dictionary, `squares`, that holds integers and their squares as key and value pairs such that: `squares[10] == 100`  
__Answer__:
```julia
squares = Dict(i => i ^ 2 for i ∈ 1:100)

for key ∈ sort(collect(keys(squares)))
    println("\t$key <--> $(squares[key])")
end

__Question__: Use an array comprehension to create an an array `squares_arr` that stores the squares for all integers between 1 and 100.  
__Answer__:
```julia
squares_arr = [ i ^ 2 for i ∈ 1:100]
println(squares_arr)
```

__Question__: Create an array, `a_ray`, with the following code: `a_ray = [1, 2, 3]`. Add the number `4` to the end of this array and then remove it.  
__Answer__:
```julia
a_ray = [1, 2, 3]
push!(a_ray, 4)
pop!(a_ray)
```

__Question__: Try to add `"Emergency"` as key to `myphonebook` with the value `string(911)` using the following code: `myphonebook["Emergency"] = 911`. Why doesn't this work?  
__Answer__: Because Julia is unable to convert a Integer value to a String key.

__Question__: Create a new dictionary called `flexible_phonebook` that has Jenny's number stored as an `integer` and Ghostbusters' number stored as a `string` with the following code `flexible_phonebook = Dict("Jenny" => 8675309, "Ghostbusters" => "555-2368")`  
__Answer__:
```julia
flexible_phonebook = Dict("Jenny" => 8675309, "Ghostbusters" => "555-2368")
```

__Question__: Add the key `"Emergency"` with the value `911` to `flexible_phonebook`  
__Answer__:
```julia
flexible_phonebook["Emergency"] = 911
```

__Question__: Why can we add an integer as a value to `flexible_phonebook` but not `myphonebook`? How could we have initialized `myphonebook` so that it would accept integers as values?  
__Answer__: Because `flexible_phonebook` accepts `Any` data type for the values.
```julia
myphonebook = Dict("Jenny" => 867-5309, "Ghostbusters" => "555-2368")
```
